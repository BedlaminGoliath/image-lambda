# image-lambda

Documentation
In your README.md include:
a description of how to use your lambda.

I myself and still understanding how this badboy works.

a description of any issues you encountered during deployment of this lambda.

I ran into issues where I was getting access issues. I was getting denied. With the help from David I was able to fix  those main issues by changing my Lambda Policies and my bucket policies.  

I also ran into a brief issue when it came to fixing those policies however it was a syntax error and I managed to get that working okay.
